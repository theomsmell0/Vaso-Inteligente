Welcome! We and my team come through this file to tell you guys how we managed to do this vase with IoT technology!

To do this, we used an ESP32 as our microcontroller, a protoboard, some jumper wires, a soil humidity sensor, a photoresistor, a small LED light, a LCD display and battery of our choice.
As software, we used VSCode as our code editor, C++ as our main programming language for the ESP32, Flask as the the main language for the server and python for the telegram bot. Also, you need the PlatformIO in VSCode to make the ESP32 project.
The project functions when the ESP32 collects the informations from the sensor placed on the vase and transmits the information to the online server that you have to put online to put all the wanted information to the 
user through Telegram. Also, if you don't have your phone on you, the display will show the user if they need to water the plant or not and if they need to put them out on the sun or not (on the Telegram chat will show
the same information, aswell as some information about the plant you set up).
The project is made interelly in portuguese but you can switch to your own languague if you want, just look for the texts that were written throughout the code. 

Good luck and make sure to show us your own project!
